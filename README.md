# CureInc
This is a game designed to simulate the United States during a virus outbreak.
To play, simply chose a difficulty, and then select upgrades on the bottom part of the screen.
Once you have purchased all upgrades you want within the given time, press either the advance day, week, or month button.
To win, the infection rate must fall bellow the desired threshold. 
You can judge your progress by the color of the map, if it is green you are very close, if it is yellow you are in the middle, and if it is red you are in danger of losing.
The player will lose once half of their population is either sick or dead due to the disease.
